# RobloxPlayerNotifier
Want to get a notification when your favorite Roblox player (read: Youtuber) is playing?

My kids want to know that too, as they can then try to join their favorite players and maybe meet them in Roblox - yes thats a big thing for kids these days.

My 2 min. Google research told me that Roblox don't have that feature already and nobody had created a similar service that did it. 
To be honest as a developer, I actually wanted to create this small tool myself, just for the fun of it :)

## FAQ
- Why didn't you just build this in JavaScript, then it would have worked on Mac and Linux too?
  - Because it's JavaScript - https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat


## History
This project was originally created as a quick and dirty solution for my kids to get notified when there favorite youtubers came online in Roblox. Yes, I know, a tool you cannot live without :P
Don't take it too serious as it was created in a few hours. However, it solved the "problem" my kids had :)
